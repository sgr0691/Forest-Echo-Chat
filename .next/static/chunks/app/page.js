They are the guardians of nature's balance, visible only to those with pure hearts and open minds. Some appear as tiny luminescent creatures, while others take the form of majestic animals or ancient tree-like entities.\\n\\nThese spirits are deeply connected to the natural world - when the forest thrives, they are joyful and generous, blessing travelers with good fortune and guidance. But when nature suffers, they grow quiet and may even become mischievous or melancholic.\\n\\nMany believe that leaving small offerings - a shiny stone, a perfect leaf, or a moment of quiet appreciation - can earn their favor. Children can often sense their presence more easily than adults, feeling their gentle whispers in the rustling leaves or catching glimpses of their glow between ancient trees at twilight.\",\n    \"What magic can I learn on my journey?\": \"The magic you can learn on your journey isn't about grand spells or dramatic transformations, but rather the subtle, profound magic that exists all around us.\\n\\nFirst, there is the magic of observation - learning to truly see the world around you. Notice how water flows around obstacles, how plants turn toward the sun, how animals move with purpose and grace. This awareness is the beginning of all magic.\\n\\nThen there is the magic of patience - understanding that the most meaningful changes happen slowly, like the growth of a mighty tree from a tiny seed. By cultivating patience, you align yourself with the rhythm of the natural world.\\n\\nThe magic of kindness is perhaps the most powerful of all. A sincere act of compassion can transform not only the recipient but the giver as well. This magic ripples outward in ways we cannot always see but are no less real.\\n\\nFinally, there is the magic of courage - the willingness to face the unknown, to stand firm in difficult moments, and to be vulnerable when necessary. True courage isn't the absence of fear, but moving forward despite it.\\n\\nThese magics cannot be forced or rushed. They must be discovered through experience, reflection, and an open heart. But once learned, they will serve you in all aspects of your journey.\",\n    \"How do I find balance with nature?\": \"Finding balance with nature begins with recognition - understanding that you are not separate from the natural world, but an integral part of it. Just as a forest ecosystem thrives through diversity and interconnection, so too does your relationship with nature.\\n\\nStart by spending time in natural settings without distraction. Sit quietly beside a stream, beneath a tree, or on a hillside. Don't try to fill this time with activity or even meditation - simply be present and observe what unfolds around you.\\n\\nPractice taking only what you need and giving back when possible. This might mean consuming mindfully, reducing waste, planting native species, or supporting conservation efforts. Small, consistent actions create powerful ripples.\\n\\nListen to the wisdom of seasonal changes. Nature moves in cycles of growth, abundance, release, and rest. Honor these same cycles within yourself instead of pushing for constant productivity and expansion.\\n\\nCultivate gratitude for the gifts nature provides - from the air you breathe to the food you eat to the beauty that surrounds you. Expressing thankfulness, even silently, strengthens your connection to the natural world.\\n\\nRemember that balance isn't a destination but a continuous dance. There will be times when you feel deeply connected and times when you feel distant. The practice is returning to awareness again and again, with patience and without judgment.\",\n    \"Tell me a story about the wind\": 'Long ago, when the world was young, the Wind had no voice. It moved silently through valleys and over mountains, invisible and unheard. Though it could touch everything - rustling leaves, moving clouds, carrying seeds across vast distances - it felt a deep loneliness, for no one acknowledged its presence or work.\\n\\nOne day, the Wind encountered a young girl sitting alone on a hillside. She was a quiet child from the village below, often overlooked and ignored by others. As the Wind passed by, it gently lifted her hair, and to its surprise, the girl smiled and whispered, \"Hello, friend.\"\\n\\nAmazed that someone had noticed it, the Wind swirled excitedly around her. The girl laughed - a clear, bright sound that carried across the hillside. The Wind tried to respond but had no voice to share its joy.\\n\\nSeeing this, the girl began to sing a simple melody. \"This can be your voice,\" she told the Wind. \"Carry my song with you.\"\\n\\nThe Wind embraced the notes, weaving them into its being. It discovered that by moving through hollow reeds, rustling leaves, or flowing around rocks, it could create sounds - whispers, howls, harmonies, and melodies.\\n\\nFrom that day forward, the Wind was never silent again. It sang through bamboo forests, hummed across desert dunes, and whistled between city buildings. People began to listen for its voice, finding messages and music in its movements.\\n\\nAnd the girl? She grew up to become a renowned musician whose compositions were inspired by the Wind\\'s ever-changing songs. On quiet evenings, she would still sit on her hillside, now with her own children, teaching them to hear the voice of her oldest friend.\\n\\nEven now, if you listen carefully when the Wind moves around you, you might catch echoes of that first song - a reminder that friendship can give voice to the voiceless and that the most powerful magic often begins with simply being noticed.'\n};\nfunction Home() {\n    _s();\n    const [messages, setMessages] = (0,react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_1__.useState)([\n        {\n            id: \"welcome\",\n            role: \"system\",\n            content: \"Welcome to the Ghibli-inspired AI assistant.

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI where machines learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Deep Learning is a further subset of ML that uses neural networks with many layers (hence 'deep') to analyze various factors of data. Think of it as concentric circles: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which is a subset of AI.\",\n        keywords: [\n            \"ai\",\n            \"ml\",\n            \"deep learning\",\n            \"machine learning\",\n            \"neural networks\",\n            \"difference\"\n        ],\n        category: \"ai-concepts\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: \"ai-3\",\n        question: \"How do large language models work?\",\n        answer: \"Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 work by using transformer neural networks trained on vast amounts of text data. They learn patterns and relationships between words and concepts through a process called unsupervised learning. During training, they predict the next word in a sequence, which helps them understand language structure. When you prompt an LLM, it uses this learned knowledge to generate text that statistically follows from your input. The model doesn't truly 'understand' content like humans do, but rather predicts what text should come next based on patterns it has observed in its training data.\",\n        keywords: [\n            \"llm\",\n            \"large language model\",\n            \"gpt\",\n            \"transformer\",\n            \"neural network\",\n            \"nlp\"\n        ],\n        category: \"ai-concepts\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: \"ai-4\",\n        question: \"What are AI hallucinations?\",\n        answer: \"AI hallucinations are instances where AI models (particularly large language models) generate information that sounds plausible but is factually incorrect or completely fabricated. These occur because the models are predicting what text should come next based on patterns in their training data, not because they understand truth or facts. Hallucinations can include made-up references, non-existent facts, or false attributions. They're particularly problematic in contexts requiring factual accuracy. Techniques like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) help reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in verified information sources.\",\n        keywords: [\n            \"hallucination\",\n            \"fabrication\",\n            \"incorrect\",\n            \"false\",\n            \"made-up\",\n            \"confabulation\"\n        ],\n        category: \"ai-concepts\"\n    },\n    {\n        id: \"ai-5\",\n        question: \"What is prompt engineering?\",\n        answer: \"Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining inputs to AI systems (particularly large language models) to get more accurate, relevant, and useful outputs. It involves crafting prompts with specific instructions, context, examples, and constraints to guide the AI's responses. Effective prompt engineering can dramatically improve an AI's performance on tasks without changing the underlying model. Techniques include few-shot prompting (providing examples), chain-of-thought prompting (asking the AI to explain its reasoning step-by-step), and role prompting (assigning the AI a specific persona or role). As AI systems evolve, prompt engineering has become a valuable skill for developers and users alike.\",\n        keywords: [\n            \"prompt\",\n            \"engineering\",\n            \"prompt design\",\n            \"instruction\",\n            \"context\",\n            \"few-shot\"\n        ],\n        category: \"ai-concepts\"\n    },\n    // Web Development - Next.js\n    {\n        id: \"nextjs-1\",\n        question: \"How do I connect to a database in Next.js?\",\n        answer: \"To connect to a database in Next.js, you can use libraries like Prisma, Drizzle, or direct database clients. For Neon PostgreSQL specifically, use the @neondatabase/serverless package and create a connection with `const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL)`.

Advantages: Stateless (no session storage needed on server), Scalable (works well with distributed systems), Cross-domain (can be used across different domains), Rich in information (can contain user roles, permissions). Considerations: Store sensitive JWTs in HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS, keep tokens short-lived and implement refresh token rotation, don't store sensitive data in payload (it's base64 encoded, not encrypted), implement proper token invalidation strategy, and use strong signing keys and algorithms (like RS256).

How CORS works: 1) Browser makes a request to a different origin, 2) Browser automatically adds Origin header with the requesting site's origin, 3) Server checks if the Origin is allowed to access the resource, 4) Server responds with Access-Control-Allow-Origin header, 5) Browser allows or blocks the response based on this header. For non-simple requests (like PUT/DELETE or with custom headers), browsers send a preflight OPTIONS request first to check permissions. CORS headers include: Access-Control-Allow-Origin (which origins can access), Access-Control-Allow-Methods (allowed HTTP methods), Access-Control-Allow-Headers (allowed request headers), Access-Control-Allow-Credentials (whether cookies can be included), and Access-Control-Max-Age (how long preflight results can be cached). CORS is configured on the server side. In Next.js, you can configure CORS in API routes using middleware or the cors npm package.

How it works: 1) Identifies code that isn't needed immediately, 2) Splits it into separate bundles, 3) Loads these bundles only when required. Implementation methods: Route-based splitting (load code for each route separately), component-based splitting (load components on demand), library-based splitting (separate vendor code from application code). In React/Next.js, implement with: dynamic imports (`import('./Component')`), React.lazy() and Suspense, Next.js automatic code splitting by pages/routes. Benefits: Reduced initial load time and bundle size, faster time to interactive, better caching (unchanged chunks remain cached), improved performance on low-end devices and slow networks, more efficient resource utilization. Considerations: Add loading states for dynamically imported components, balance between too many small chunks (HTTP request overhead) and too few large chunks, preload critical chunks that will be needed soon.

Implementation approaches: Manual registration and cache management, using Workbox library (recommended), PWA frameworks and tools.
